= Hazelcast IMDG Release Notes 

Welcome to the Hazelcast IMDG Release Notes.
This document includes the new features, enhancements
and fixed issues for Hazelcast IMDG releases.
The linked numbers refer to the issue number in the Hazelcast IMDG GitHub repository.

Please select a release from the Table of Contents on the left panel to see its release notes.

NOTE: New feature and enhancement listings are grouped by
Hazelcast IMDG editions, i.e., open source and enterprise.
The purpose of this is to separate the ones that belong to the
enterprise edition. The open source ones are already included
in the enterprise edition.
